<!-- Used the p tag to write a few sentences about myself-->
    <body>
        <p>This is the about me page.</p>
        <p>My name is Dante Suarez.</p>
        <p>I am a computer science major at UMass Lowell who is planning to graduate in May 2023.</p>
        <!--Added an unordered list of my various interests-->
        <p>My many interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Snowboarding</li>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Watching sports (especially football)</li>
                <li>Computers</li>
                <li>Listening to Music</li>
                <li>Going to art museums</li>
            </ul>
        <p>One day I plan on becoming a cybersecurity architect and moving out west to Oregon or Washington so that I can snowboard for a much longer portion of the year.</p>
